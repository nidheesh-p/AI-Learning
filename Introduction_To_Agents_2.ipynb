headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Founded in 1975, the company became influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. It is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public companies,[a] and one of the most valuable brands globally. Microsoft is considered part of the Big Tech group, alongside Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.\\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to market BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000\\xa0millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011,[2] an increased focus on hardware[3][4] that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing,[5][6] as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2\\xa0billion in 2016.[7] Under Nadella's direction, the company has expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023.[8]\\nMicrosoft has been dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet editor, and the PowerPoint presentation program. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com (Hotmail) email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.[citation needed]\\nIn April 2019, Microsoft became the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software received criticism for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='History\\nMain article: History of Microsoft\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\\n1972–1985: Founding\\nAn Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\\nPaul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[9]:\\u200a228\\u200a\\nBill Gates and Paul Allen\\'s Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center\\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[10] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[11]\\nThe January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems\\'s (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[12] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[9]:\\u200a108,\\u200a112–114\\u200a Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[13] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft\", short for micro-computer software.[14][15] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[16] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[13]\\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[17] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company\\'s dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[18] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[19][20]:\\u200a210\\u200a The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[9]:\\u200a232\\u200a\\nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[21] Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[22] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[23]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='1985–1994: Windows and Office\\nWindows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\\nMicrosoft released Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[9]:\\u200a242–243,\\u200a246\\u200a despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM that August.[24] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public with an initial public offering (IPO) at the NASDAQ exchange on March 13,[25] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000\\xa0millionaires from Microsoft employees.[26] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[9] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[27] :\\u200a243–244\\u200a Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[28]\\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[9]:\\u200a301\\u200a On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[29] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[30][31]\\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice\\'s Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive per processor licenses.

After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[227][228] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[229][230]\\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[231] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft\\'s chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled\", attempted to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google\\'s paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch were highly critical of the advertising campaign,[232] while Google employees embraced it.[233]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Layoffs\\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[234][235] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[236] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with eliminating 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[237] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[238] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950\\xa0million, of which approximately $200\\xa0million will relate to severance payments.[239]\\nMicrosoft laid off 1,900 employees in its gaming division in January 2024. The layoffs primarily affected Activision Blizzard employees, but some Xbox and ZeniMax employees were also affected.[240] Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and chief design officer Allen Adham also resigned.[241]\\nIn May 2025, Microsoft announced that it is laying off more than 6,000 employees, around three percent of the company\\'s entire workforce.[242] In July 2025, Microsoft announced another round of layoffs, cutting approximately 9,000 employees in its largest workforce reduction in over two years. The cuts affected multiple divisions, including Xbox, with 830 positions eliminated at its Redmond, Washington headquarters.[243][244] Amid the layoffs, Microsoft also announced that it was quitting Pakistan after 25 years of operations.[245][246] While the exit was part of shift in business strategies and preference for cloud based models, the company\\'s exit from Pakistan was also reportedly attributed to \"growing difficulties\" with the country\\'s business environment.[247]\\n\\nUnions\\nMicrosoft recognizes seven trade unions[c] representing 1,750 workers in the United States at its video game subsidiaries Activision Blizzard and ZeniMax Media.[248] U.S. workers have been vocal in opposing military and law-enforcement contracts with Microsoft.[249] Bethesda Game Studios is unionized in Canada.[250] Microsoft South Korea has recognized its union since 2017.[251][252] German employees have elected works councils since 1998.[253]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='United States government\\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in its software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix.

In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don\\'t participate in it.\"[257]\\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[258] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize that it takes its customers\\' privacy and data protection very seriously, saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an \\'advanced persistent threat,\\' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[259] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft\\'s encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program, it opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[260] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[261]\\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company\\'s and customers\\' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ).

MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[265][266] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[267] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[268] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[269]\\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[270] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I\\'m [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[271]\\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I\\'d certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[272] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[273]\\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after it allowed gender expression.[274]\\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[275] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[276]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Environment\\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on the sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said, \"We are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today\",[277] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers\".[278] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[279]\\nMicrosoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace\\'s Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to its policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[280] Microsoft\\'s timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products was 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear.

It created one of the world\\'s largest private bus systems, the \"Connector\", to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The \"Connector\" does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[283]\\nMicrosoft also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[282][284] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[285] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World\\'s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[286]\\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[287][288][289] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[290] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA\\'s Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company\\'s all-renewable energy use since 2014.[296]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[297][298] Despite spending spent more than $760 million through its Climate Innovation Fund by June 2024 on sustainability projects—including purchases of more than 5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide removal with carbon offsets and more than 34 megawatts of renewable energy—Microsoft's Scope 3 emissions had increased by 31% from the company's 2020 baseline, which caused the company's total emissions to rise by 29% in 2023.[299]\\nIn 2023 Microsoft consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, or Tunisia.[300]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Headquarters\\nBuilding 92, home to the Microsoft Visitor Center\\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington.[301] Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13.

The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[308] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney\\'s Pitt Street Mall.[309]\\n\\nLogo\\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"Pac-Man Logo\", designed by Scott Baker, on February 26, 1987, with the concept being similar to InFocus Corporation logo that was adapted a year earlier in 1986. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed\".[310] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.[311]\\nMicrosoft\\'s logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of \"Where do you want to go today?\"[312][313][314] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company\\'s next tagline, \"Be What\\'s Next.\"[315] It also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[316] The Microsoft Pac-Man logo was used for 25 years, 5 months, and 28 days until August 23, 2012, being the longest enduring logo to be used by the company.\\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company\\'s shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[317] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft\\'s four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[318] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[319][320]\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft logo history\\n\\n\\nc.\\u20091975–1980: First Microsoft logo.\\n\\n\\n\\n1980–June 25, 1982: Second Microsoft logo.\\n\\n\\n\\nJune 25, 1982–February 26, 1987: Third Microsoft logo.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Microsoft logo history\\n\\n\\nc.\\u20091975–1980: First Microsoft logo.\\n\\n\\n\\n1980–June 25, 1982: Second Microsoft logo.\\n\\n\\n\\nJune 25, 1982–February 26, 1987: Third Microsoft logo.\\n\\n\\n\\nFebruary 26, 1987–August 23, 2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker.[312][313]\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 23, 2012–present: Fifth and current Microsoft logo.[321]\\n\\n\\nSponsorship\\nToyota Yaris WRC with sprayed on Microsoft logos\\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland\\'s national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015,[322] a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020) and a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nIn 2015, Microsoft Philanthropies, an internal charitable organization, was established to bring the benefits of technology and the digital revolution to areas and groups that lack them. The organisation\\'s key areas of focus are: donating cloud computing resources to university researchers and nonprofit groups; supporting the expansion of broadband access worldwide; funding international computer science education through YouthSpark; supporting tech education in the U.S. from kindergarten to high school; and donating to global child and refugee relief organizations.[323][324]\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft\\'s president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[325]\\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Government of Russia and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[326][327]\\nMicrosoft also supports initiatives through its AI for Accessibility grant program, providing funding to various global organizations that create technologies to enhance accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Among grant recipients from the Asia-Pacific region are Sri Lankan IT company Fortude, Thailand-based Vulcan Coalition, and Indonesian organization Kerjabilitas.[328]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Controversies\\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\\nPRISM is a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Microsoft and Facebook.[329]\\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company\\'s software. It has also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary\", and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[330] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop\", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article,[331] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft\\'s own employees.[332] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\\nAs reported by several news outlets,[333][334] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for \\'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[334]\\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%\". When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[335][336] In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to mis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade.[337]\\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[338] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[339] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[340] that was used internally by Microsoft[341] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by The Guardian[342] and The Washington Post[343] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[344] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[345]\\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[346]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"Jesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[346]\\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[347]\\nIn June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market power by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The European Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft's practice since 2019 gave Teams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite Microsoft's efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained unconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce. Microsoft's Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300 million in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2 billion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses.[348]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft', 'title': 'Microsoft - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\\nIn October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal,[349] who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians killed in the Gaza war. The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid\", sought to address the company\\'s involvement in the Israeli government\\'s use of its technology.[350] In February 2025, the Associated Press reported that the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and intelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement confirming that these services had been made available to Israel, while denying that these tools were employed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[351] On March 20, 2025, before an event at Seattle\\'s Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft powers genocide\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman at a speaking event on April 4, 2025, in protest at the company\\'s support of Israel.[352] After the disruptions at these events, Microsoft contacted the FBI in search of assistance in surveilling its pro-Palestinian employees and their allies.[353] The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[354] In August 2025 it was reported that Microsoft provides storage for mass-surveilled Palestinian phone calls that have been used to identify bombing targets in Gaza.[355] On August 20, 20 Microsoft employees and their allies were arrested after refusing to disperse from a protest on Microsoft\\'s Redmond, Washington campus.[353]\\nIn November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft, focusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses. The probe scrutinized Microsoft\\'s bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools, as well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader efforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair Lina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft\\'s licensing practices potentially locking customers into its services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.[356]\\nIn June 2025 Microsoft helped suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor in the Netherlands who was investigating Israel for war crimes in order to comply with a Trump executive order.[357][358] In June 2025, a UN expert\\'s report named Microsoft as being \"central to Israel\\'s surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction.\"[359]\\n\\nSee also\\nList of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\\nMicrosoft engineering groups\\nMicrosoft Enterprise Agreement\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ Second behind Nvidia, as of September 2025\\n\\n^ After Apple and Amazon, respectively\\n\\n^ Game Workers Alliance (Raven Software)Game Workers Alliance AlbanyActivision Quality Assurance United-CWAZeniMax Workers United/CWAOneBGS (Bethesda Game Studios)World of WarcraftTexas Blizzard QA United-CWA\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor.[95] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history.[96] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[97] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[98] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.[99] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million.[100][101]\n",
            "On January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of its first interactive whiteboard, named Surface Hub.[102] On July 29, 2015, Windows 10 was released,[103] with its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third-largest maker of mobile phones, selling 33 million units (7.2% of all). While a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone — those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same timeframe 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (mostly Microsoft).[104] Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[105] During the summer of 2015 the company lost $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business, firing 7,800 employees.[106]\n",

            "On March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.[108] On January 24, 2017, Microsoft showcased Intune for Education at the BETT 2017 education technology conference in London.[109] Intune for Education is a new cloud-based application and device management service for the education sector.[110] In May 2016, the company announced it was laying off 1,850 workers, and taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million.[106]\n",
            "In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[111] In November 2016, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York.[112] The cost of each Platinum membership is US$500,000 per year.[113] Some analysts deemed this unthinkable ten years prior, however, as in 2001 then-CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \"cancer\".[114] Microsoft planned to launch a preview of Intune for Education \"in the coming weeks\", with general availability scheduled for spring 2017, priced at $30 per device, or through volume licensing agreements.[115]\n",

Users can ensure that their calls are encrypted and can utilize a security code that both parties on a call must verify on their respective ends.[155] On October 7, Microsoft acquired Ally.io, a software service that measures companies' progress against OKRs.

Microsoft has not released statements regarding Activision's recent legal controversies regarding employee abuse, but reports have alleged that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, a major target of the controversy, will leave the company after the acquisition is finalized.[161] The deal was closed on October 13, 2023.[162]\n",

            "In October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal,[349] who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians killed in the Gaza war. The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid\", sought to address the company's involvement in the Israeli government's use of its technology.[350] In February 2025, the Associated Press reported that the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and intelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement confirming that these services had been made available to Israel, while denying that these tools were employed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[351] On March 20, 2025, before an event at Seattle's Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft powers genocide\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman at a speaking event on April 4, 2025, in protest at the company's support of Israel.[352] After the disruptions at these events, Microsoft contacted the FBI in search of assistance in surveilling its pro-Palestinian employees and their allies.[353] The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[354] In August 2025 it was reported that Microsoft provides storage for mass-surveilled Palestinian phone calls that have been used to identify bombing targets in Gaza.[355] On August 20, 20 Microsoft employees and their allies were arrested after refusing to disperse from a protest on Microsoft's Redmond, Washington campus.[353]\n",
            "In November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft, focusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses. The probe scrutinized Microsoft's bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools, as well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader efforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair Lina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft's licensing practices potentially locking customers into its services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.[356]\n",
